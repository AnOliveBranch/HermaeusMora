# What is Hermaeus Mora?

Hermaeus Mora is a Discord bot that connects to the [NexusMods](https://nexusmods.com) API
to retrieve versioning and download link information for a given mod.

# How do I use it?

Currently, the bot is in testing phases and is not permitted to be added to public server
to comply with the Nexus API [Acceptable Use Policy](https://help.nexusmods.com/article/114-api-acceptable-use-policy).
Once the project is more polished, it will be submitted to Nexus for public approval.
Until then, it is only available "publicly" in [Lexy's LOTD Server](https://discord.gg/xj7JcZ7)
and available for testing by cloning this repository and using your own API key.

The bot makes use of Discord slash commands, which Discord will reognize and help autocomplete,
including command arguments. The available commands and arguments are as follows:

`/nexus link:<link> version:<version>`
